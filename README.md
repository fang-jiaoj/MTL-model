# MTL-model
Installation
Before you run the code, we are recommended you to create a conda environment for example:
conda env create -f environment.yml

Then activate the environment:

conda activate MTATFP

Usage
1. You can run all the code in the model_code directory with Data\MTL_data.
2. You can also directly use the MTL FP-GNN\ trained model combined with MTL FP-GNN code to predict your data.
